problem Statement:
Using the provided customer churn dataset, the goal is to develop a predictive model to identify factors that influence customer churn and to predict which customers are likely to churn in the future. This involves exploring the data, identifying relevant features, and employing machine learning techniques to build a model that can accurately predict churn.


This project focuses on analyzing customer churn within a business context. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers cease doing business with a company. Understanding and predicting churn is crucial for businesses as it directly impacts revenue and growth. This project utilizes advanced analytics techniques, including machine learning algorithms and data visualization, to gain insights into customer behavior and predict potential churn.
